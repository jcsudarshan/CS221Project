Notes on Wilson paper

4 classifications - positive, negative, both, neutral
2 Goals:
	1. classify expressions as polar vs neutral (contextually)
	2. classify polar expressions from goal 1 as positive, negative, both (contextually)
Not classifying entire sentence or document
Started with prior polarity values for each polar word (positive, negative, neutral)
Words are also tagged with how subjective they are (strong or weak). This is a reliability measure.
Used dependency parser and relations between nodes
Also used some bag of words features and token windows
Separate feature vector for each of 2 goals
Features were hand picked to be linguistically meaningful
Learned via BoosTexter AdaBoost.HM algorithm (Schapire and Singer, 2000)
